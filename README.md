# Direct Analysis Method vs. Effective Length Method: A Literature Review

This repository contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDF for the literature review:

This literature review compares two primary methods for steel frame stability design: the Direct Analysis Method (DAM) and the Effective Length Method (ELM). It examines their theoretical formulations, AISC code provisions, advantages, limitations, and current trends in practice. Key findings emphasize the shift toward DAM for reliability in modern design, while ELM remains useful for simpler, preliminary calculations.
